ChatApp (MERN + Socket.io)

ChatApp is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication. This project demonstrates the implementation of a fully functional chat application with features like user authentication, live messaging, and persistent message storage.
